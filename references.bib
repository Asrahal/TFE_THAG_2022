  abstract = {Antiandrogens are frequently used with estradiol in transgender women seeking feminization. Antiandrogens act by various mechanisms to decrease the production or effects of testosterone, but it is unclear which antiandrogen is most effective at feminization. A systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines. We searched online databases (Medline, Embase and PsycINFO) and references of relevant articles for studies of antiandrogens in transgender women aged 16+ years to achieve feminization (namely changes in breast size, body composition, facial or body hair) or changes in serum total testosterone concentration when compared to placebo, estradiol alone or an alternative antiandrogen. Four studies fulfilled eligibility criteria and were included in a narrative review. The addition of cyproterone acetate, leuprolide and medroxyprogesterone acetate may be more effective than spironolactone or estradiol alone at suppressing the serum total testosterone concentration. Body composition changes appear similar in transgender women treated with estradiol and additional cyproterone acetate or leuprolide. No eligible studies adequately evaluated the effects of antiandrogens on breast development or facial and body hair reduction. It remains unclear which antiandrogen is most effective at achieving feminization. Cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and leuprolide may be more effective than spironolactone at suppressing the serum total testosterone concentration. However, due to spironolactone's antagonism of the androgen receptor, it is unclear whether this results in clinically meaningful differences in feminization. Further research with clinically meaningful endpoints is needed to optimize the use of antiandrogens in transgender women.},

Transgender (trans) youth experience barriers to needed gender-affirming care, often rooted in ethical and legal issues, such as healthcare provider concerns regarding youth capacity and rights to consent to hormone therapy. Even when decision-making capacity is present, youth may lack the legal authority to give consent. The aims of this paper are therefore to provide an empirical analysis of minor trans youth capacity to consent to hormone therapy and to address the normative question of whether there is ethical justification for granting trans youth the authority to consent to this care. Through qualitative content analysis of interviews with trans youth, parents, and healthcare providers, we found that trans youth demonstrated the understandings and abilities characteristic of the capacity to consent to hormone therapy and that they did consent to hormone therapy with positive outcomes. Employing deontological and consequentialist reasoning and drawing on a foundation of empirical evidence, human rights, and best interests we conclude that granting trans youth with decisional capacity both the right and the legal authority to consent to hormone therapy via the informed consent model of care is ethically justified.},

Insights into vascular pathophysiology and outcomes in transgender people receiving sex steroids could be fundamental in providing better care for this population through the management of cardiovascular risk and more broadly advance our understanding of the role of sex and gender in vascular health and disease. In addition, there is a need to understand how gender-affirming hormone therapy impacts cardiovascular disease risk and events as transgender individuals age. This review explores the available evidence on the associations between gender-affirming hormones and cardiovascular events such as coronary artery disease, stroke, hypertension, thrombosis, lipid abnormalities, and diabetes mellitus. Current research about vascular outcomes in adults receiving hormonal therapy is limited by the absence of large cohort studies, lack of appropriate control populations, and inadequate data acquisition from gender identity services. Existing epidemiological data suggest that the use of estrogens in transgender females confers an increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Conversely, transgender males receiving testosterone lack any consistent or convincing evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Further studies are required to confirm whether such risk exists and the mechanisms by which they occur.},

Participants               2260 adult trans women (male sex assigned at birth, female gender identity) and 1229 adult trans men (female sex assigned at birth, male gender identity) who received gender affirming hormone treatment.                                         Main outcome measures               Incidence and characteristics (eg, histology, hormone receptor status) of breast cancer in transgender people.                                         Results               The total person time in this cohort was 33\,991 years for trans women and 14\,883 years for trans men. In the 2260 trans women in the cohort, 15 cases of invasive breast cancer were identified (median duration of hormone treatment 18 years, range 7-37 years). This was 46-fold higher than in cisgender men (standardised incidence ratio 46.7, 95\% confidence interval 27.2 to 75.4) but lower than in cisgender women (0.3, 0.2 to 0.4). Most tumours were of ductal origin and oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and 8.3\% were human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) positive. In 1229 trans men, four cases of invasive breast cancer were identified (median duration of hormone treatment 15 years, range 2-17 years). This was lower than expected compared with cisgender women (standardised incidence ratio 0.2, 95\% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.5).                                         Conclusions               This study showed an increased risk of breast cancer in trans women compared with cisgender men, and a lower risk in trans men compared with cisgender women. In trans women, the risk of breast cancer increased during a relatively short duration of hormone treatment and the characteristics of the breast cancer resembled a more female pattern. These results suggest that breast cancer screening guidelines for cisgender people are sufficient for transgender people using hormone treatment.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potential risk of estrogen therapy. However, data show an improvement in the quality of life for transgender people who use feminizing hormone therapy. With few transgender-specific data, guidance may be drawn from cisgender (nontransgender) data, with a focus on hormonal birth control and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The aim of this review is to examine the degree to which routes of administration, patient comorbidities, and type of hormone utilized affect the safety of estrogen therapy. Methods: We identified 6,349 studies by searching PubMed with the terms ``transgender'', ``estrogen'', ``VTE'', and ``HRT''. Of these, there were only 13 studies between 1989 and 2018 that investigated the effects of hormone therapy, including types of estrogens used, in transgender women and men. Results: The data suggest that the route of hormone administration, patient demographics, and patient comorbidities all affect estrogen's link with VTE. For example, avoiding ethinyl estradiol might make the use of hormone therapy in trans feminine individuals safer than oral birth control. Data from both cis and trans groups suggest additional VTE risk associated with the use of progestins. While transdermal estrogens dosed up to 0.1 mg/day or below appear lower risk for VTE than other forms of estrogen, it is unclear whether this is related to the delivery method or a dose effect. Finally, even if the risk from exogenous estrogen use remains significant statistically, the absolute clinical risk remains low. Conclusion: Clinicians should avoid the use of ethinyl estradiol. Additionally, data suggest that progestins should be avoided for transgender individuals. Further study of the relationship between estrogen use and the risk of VTE will serve to inform the safest care strategies for transgender individuals.},

  abstract = {Purpose: There are no large-scale studies examining mental health among transgender and nonbinary youth who receive gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). The purpose of this study is to examine associations among access to GAHT with depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide among a large sample of transgender and nonbinary youth. Methods: Data were collected as part of a 2020 survey of 34,759 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youth aged 13e24, including 11,914 transgender or nonbinary youth. Adjusted logistic regression assessed whether receipt of GAHT was associated with lower levels of depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide among those who wanted to receive GAHT. Results: Half of transgender and nonbinary youth said they were not using GAHT but would like to, 36\% were not interested in receiving GAHT, and 14\% were receiving GAHT. Parent support for their child's gender identity had a strong relationship with receipt of GAHT, with nearly 80\% of those who received GAHT reporting they had at least one parent who supported their gender identity. Use of GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] {$\frac{1}{4}$} .73, p {$<$} .001) and seriously considering suicide (aOR {$\frac{1}{4}$} .74, p {$<$} .001) compared to those who wanted GAHT but did not receive it. For youth under age 18, GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression (aOR {$\frac{1}{4}$} .61, p {$<$} .01) and of a past-year suicide attempt (aOR {$\frac{1}{4}$} .62, p {$<$} .05). Conclusions: Findings support a relationship between access to GAHT and lower rates of depression and suicidality among transgender and nonbinary youth. \'O 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

  abstract = {Testosterone therapy is a cornerstone of medical treatment for transgender men who choose to undergo it. The goal of testosterone therapy is usually to achieve serum testosterone concentrations in the male reference range. Testosterone has several desired effects as well as undesired and unknown effects. The desired effects include increased facial and body hair, increased lean mass and strength, decreased fat mass, deepening of the voice, increased sexual desire, cessation of menstruation, clitoral enlargement, and reductions in gender dysphoria, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. Achievement of these goals comes with potential undesired effects and risks including acne, alopecia, reduced HDL cholesterol, increased triglycerides, and a possible increase in systolic blood pressure. An additional benefit of testosterone therapy (with or without mastectomy) is a reduced risk of breast cancer. Most of the effects of testosterone start to develop within several months of starting therapy, although facial hair and alopecia continue to develop after 1 year. A major limitation in the study of testosterone therapy for transgender men is a paucity of high-quality data due to a shortage of randomised controlled trials (partly because of ethical issues), few prospective and long-term studies, the use of suboptimum control groups, loss to follow-up, and difficulties in recruitment of representative samples of transgender populations.},

We cover up-to-date information on: (1) feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT); (2) benefits associated with GAHT, particularly quality of life, mental health, breast development and bone health; (3) potential risks associated with GAHT, including cardiovascular disease and infertility; and (4) other health considerations like HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, other tumours, voice therapy, dermatology, the brain and cognition, and aging. Although equally deserving of mention, feminizing gender-affirming surgery, paediatric and adolescent populations, and gender nonbinary individuals are beyond the scope of this review. While much of the data we discuss come from Europe, the creation of a United States transgender cohort has already contributed important retrospective data that are also summarized here. Much remains to be determined regarding health considerations for TW. Patients and providers will benefit from larger and longer prospective studies involving TW, particularly regarding the effects of aging, race and ethnicity, type of hormonal treatment (e.g. different oestrogens, anti-androgens) and routes of administration (e.g. oral, parenteral, transdermal) on all the topics we address.},

  abstract = {The field of transgender health continues to expand rapidly, including research in the area of family planning. While much attention has been given to fertility preservation and the parenting intentions of transgender individuals, far less has been paid to pregnancy prevention and contraceptive needs of people along the transmasculine gender spectrum (transgender men and gender-nonbinary persons who were assigned female at birth). Existing research illustrates that many clinicians and transmasculine individuals falsely believe that there is no risk of pregnancy while amenorrheic. These studies also show inconsistent counseling practices provided to transmasculine persons surrounding contraception and pregnancy while falling short of providing robust clinical guidance for improvement. Clinicians report a lack of adequate training in transgender reproductive health, and consequently, many do not feel comfortable treating transgender patients. The aim of this publication is to consolidate the findings of these prior studies and build upon them to offer comprehensive clinical guidance for managing contraception in transmasculine patients. To do so, it reviews the physiologic effects of testosterone on the sex steroid axis and current understanding of why ovulation and pregnancy may still occur while amenorrheic. Gender-inclusive terminology and a suggested script for eliciting a gender-affirming sexual history are offered. Common concerns (such as the effects on gender dysphoria and gender affirmation) and side effects of available contraceptive methods are subsequently addressed and how these may have a unique impact on transmasculine persons as compared with cisgender women. Lastly, a model is provided for approaching contraceptive counseling in the transmasculine population to assist clinicians and patients in determining the need for and selection of the type of contraception. To center transmasculine voices, the development of this publication's guidelines have been led by reproductive care clinicians of transgender experience.},

With the aim of systematically reviewing the available literature in this field, this study identifies 31 papers that explore the rates of NSSI and suicidality in trans people. From reviewing the literature, it was revealed that trans people have a higher prevalence of NSSI and suicidality compared to the cisgender (non-trans) population. There appear to be some gender differences within these rates, with trans men at a greater risk for NSSI behaviour. Prevalence rates differ depending on the different stages of transition, but they are still overall greater than the cisgender population. The study concludes that trans individuals are at a greater risk of NSSI behaviour and suicidality than the cisgender population, and discusses risk factors and the need to develop effective preventative interventions.},

We thematically summarize the health care experiences of transgender youth living in the southeast United States to identify potential barriers and facilitators to health care. Design and methods Transgender youth recruited from community settings in an urban area of the southeast United States participated in individual interviews (n~=~33) and focus groups (n~=~9) about protective factors. We conducted a thematic analysis of data from 42 participants who described their experiences seeking and receiving health care. Results Participants reported a wide range of gender identities. The individual interview sample was majority Black (54.5\%) and the mean age was 21.7~years and focus group participants were all white and the mean age was 16.8~years. Participants described numerous barriers to health care, including limited availability of gender affirming care, logistical challenges, such as gatekeeping and cost, concerns about confidentiality in relation to sexual behavior and gender identity, and inadequate cultural competency among providers regarding gender-affirming care. Facilitators included intake procedures collecting chosen pronouns and names and consistent use of them by providers, and open communication, including active listening. Conclusions Findings underscore the need for a multi-component approach to ensure both transgender- and youth-friendly care. Practice implications Providers and office staff may benefit from transgender cultural competency trainings. In addition, clinic protocols relating to confidentiality and chosen name and pronoun use may help facilitate access to and receipt of quality care.},

  abstract = {Background: Transgender individuals experience unique vulnerabilities to intimate partner violence (IPV) and may experience a disproportionate IPV burden compared with cisgender (nontransgender) individuals.             Objectives: To systematically review the quantitative literature on prevalence and correlates of IPV in transgender populations.             Search Methods: Authors searched research databases (PubMed, CINAHL), gray literature (Google), journal tables of contents, and conference abstracts, and consulted experts in the field. Authors were contacted with data requests in cases in which transgender participants were enrolled in a study, but no disaggregated statistics were provided for this population.             Selection Criteria: We included all quantitative literature published before July 2019 on prevalence and correlates of IPV victimization, perpetration, or service utilization in transgender populations. There were no restrictions by sample size, year, or location.             Data Collection and Analysis: Two independent reviewers conducted screening. One reviewer conducted extraction by using a structured database, and a second reviewer checked for mistakes or omissions. We used random-effects meta-analyses to calculate relative risks (RRs) comparing the prevalence of IPV in transgender individuals and cisgender individuals in studies in which both transgender and cisgender individuals were enrolled. We also used meta-analysis to compare IPV prevalence in assigned-female-sex-at-birth and assigned-male-sex-at-birth transgender individuals and to compare physical IPV prevalence between nonbinary and binary transgender individuals in studies that enrolled both groups.                            Main Results: We identified 85 articles from 74 unique data sets (n               total               \,=\,49\,966 transgender participants). Across studies reporting it, the median lifetime prevalence of physical IPV was 37.5\%, lifetime sexual IPV was 25.0\%, past-year physical IPV was 16.7\%, and past-year sexual IPV was 10.8\% among transgender individuals. Compared with cisgender individuals, transgender individuals were 1.7 times more likely to experience any IPV (RR\,=\,1.66; 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,1.36, 2.03), 2.2 times more likely to experience physical IPV (RR\,=\,2.19; 95\% CI\,=\,1.66, 2.88), and 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual IPV (RR\,=\,2.46; 95\% CI\,=\,1.64, 3.69). Disparities persisted when comparing to cisgender women specifically. There was no significant difference in any IPV, physical IPV, or sexual IPV prevalence between assigned-female-sex-at-birth and assigned-male-sex-at-birth individuals, nor in physical IPV prevalence between binary- and nonbinary-identified transgender individuals. IPV victimization was associated with sexual risk, substance use, and mental health burden in transgender populations.                          Authors' Conclusions: Transgender individuals experience a dramatically higher prevalence of IPV victimization compared with cisgender individuals, regardless of sex assigned at birth. IPV prevalence estimates are comparably high for assigned-male-sex-at-birth and assigned-female-sex-at-birth transgender individuals, and for binary and nonbinary transgender individuals, though more research is needed.             Public Health Implications: Evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to prevent and address IPV in this high-risk population with unique needs. Lack of legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing, and social services likely foster vulnerability to IPV. Transgender individuals should be explicitly included in US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations promoting IPV screening in primary care settings. Interventions at the policy level as well as the interpersonal and individual level are urgently needed to address epidemic levels of IPV in this marginalized, high-risk population.},

Greater effect sizes were observed for expectations of rejection and internalized transphobia when compared to distal stress and concealment. Future research on the relationship between minority stress, depression, and suicide would benefit from longitudinal designs and more diverse and representative samples of TGD individuals.},

METHODS We analyzed data from 506 transgender women (1045 total visits) and 120 transgender men (209 total visits) who attended 26 publicly funded clinics that provide STD services in 6 US cities during a 3.5-year observation period. We used clinical and laboratory data to examine the proportion of transgender women and transgender men who tested positive for urogenital and extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infections and who self-reported or tested positive for HIV infection during the observation period. RESULTS Of the transgender women tested, 13.1\% tested positive for chlamydia and 12.6\% tested positive for gonorrhea at 1 or more anatomic sites, and 14.2\% were HIV-infected. Of transgender men tested, 7.7\% and 10.5\% tested positive for chlamydia and gonorrhea at 1 or more anatomic sites, and 8.3\% were HIV-infected. Most transgender women (86.0\% and 80.9\%, respectively) and more than a quarter of transgender men (28.6\% and 28.6\%, respectively) with an extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infection had a negative urogenital test at the same visit. CONCLUSIONS Publicly funded clinics providing STD services are likely an important source of STD care for transgender persons. More data are needed to understand the most effective screening approaches for urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in transgender populations.},

Methods Factor (F)II, FIX, FXI, protein (p)C and free pS, fibrinogen, hematocrit, sex hormone-binding globulin, and normalized activated protein C ratio were measured in 98 transwomen (male sex at birth, female gender identity) and 100 transmen (female sex at birth, male gender identity) before and after 12 months of GAHT (oral or transdermal estradiol and anti-androgens in transwomen, transdermal or intramuscular testosterone in transmen). Mean paired differences in coagulation measurements were estimated with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). Differences for route of administration and age were assessed with linear regression. Results After GAHT, transwomen had more procoagulant profiles with a mean increase in FIX: 9.6 IU/dL (95\% CI 3.1\textendash 16.0) and FXI: 13.5 IU/dL (95\% CI 9.5\textendash 17.5), and a decrease in pC: -7.7 IU/dL (95\% CI -10.1 to -5.2). Changes in measures of coagulation were influenced by route of administration (oral vs. transdermal) and age. A higher sex-hormone binding globulin level after 12 months was associated with a lower activated protein C resistance. In transmen, changes were not procoagulant overall and were influenced by age. Differences for route of administration (transdermal vs. intramuscular) were small. Conclusions GAHT in transmen was not associated with apparent procoagulant changes, which provides some reassurance regarding VTE risk. In transwomen, GAHT resulted in procoagulant changes, which likely contributes to the observed increased VTE risk.},

  abstract = {Researchers currently lack a reliable and valid means of assessing minority stress and resilience factors in transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) people. This study was conducted to develop and evaluate the validity of a tool to better assess these constructs in TGNC populations. The Gender Minority Stress and Resilience (GMSR) measure was developed grounded on Meyer's minority stress model, and adjusted to reflect the experiences of TGNC populations based on TGNC literature and archival data from TGNC focus groups. The final GMSR includes scales assessing 9 constructs: gender-related discrimination, gender-related rejection, gender-related victimization, nonaffirmation of gender identity, internalized transphobia, negative expectations for future events, nondisclosure, community connectedness, and pride. In the current study, 844 participants completed the GMSR measure as well as measures related to mental health, general life stress, and social support. Results indicated good model fit, criterion validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity for the 9 hypothesized scales. Discriminant validity for the scales were also partially supported. Overall, the current study offers preliminary evidence of the reliability and validity of the GMSR Measure for use with TGNC populations. The GMSR Measure has several uses for both research and clinical purposes, including increasing understanding of the experiences and correlates of gender minority stress and resilience factors and assessing whether specific therapies or interventions are helpful in reducing risk and supporting resilience in TGNC populations.},

A systematic search resulted in 35 qualitative studies for analysis. Studies included 1,607 TGNC participants, ages 16\textendash 64 years. Analytic methods included mostly interviews and focus groups; the most common analysis strategy was theme analysis. Key themes in findings were patient challenges, needs, and strengths. Challenges dominated findings and could be summarized by lack of provider knowledge and sensitivity and financial and insurance barriers, which hurt TGNC people's health. Future qualitative research should explore the experiences of diverse and specific groups of TGNC people (youth, non-binary, racial/ethnic minority), include community-based methods, and theory development. Practice-wise, training for providers and skills and support for TGNC people to advocate to improve their health, are required.},

  abstract = {Gender-affirming treatment of transgender people requires a multidisciplinary approach in which endocrinologists play a crucial role. The aim of this paper is to review recent data on hormonal treatment of this population and its effect on physical, psychological, and mental health. The Endocrine Society guidelines for transgender women include estrogens in combination with androgen-lowering medications. Feminizing treatment with estrogens and antiandrogens has desired physical changes, such as enhanced breast growth, reduction of facial and body hair growth, and fat redistribution in a female pattern. Possible side effects should be discussed with patients, particularly those at risk for venous thromboembolism. The Endocrine Society guidelines for transgender men include testosterone therapy for virilization with deepening of the voice, cessation of menses, and increases of muscle mass and facial and body hair. Owing to the lack of evidence, treatment of gender nonbinary people should be individualized. Young people may receive pubertal suspension, consisting of GnRH analogs, later followed by sex steroids. Options for fertility preservation should be discussed before any hormonal intervention. Morbidity and cardiovascular risk with cross-sex hormones is unchanged among transgender men and unclear among transgender women. Sex steroid-related malignancies can occur but are rare. Mental health problems such as depression and anxiety have been found to reduce considerably following hormonal treatment. Future studies should aim to explore the long-term outcome of hormonal treatment in transgender people and provide evidence as to the effect of gender-affirming treatment in the nonbinary population.},

  abstract = {Gender-based violence (GBV) is an umbrella term for any harm that is perpetrated against a person's will and that results from power inequalities based on gender roles. Most global estimates of GBV implicitly refer only to the experiences of cisgender, heterosexually identified women, which often comes at the exclusion of transgender and gender nonconforming (trans) populations. Those who perpetrate violence against trans populations often target gender nonconformity, gender expression or identity, and perceived sexual orientation and thus these forms of violence should be considered within broader discussions of GBV. Nascent epidemiologic research suggests a high burden of GBV among trans populations, with an estimated prevalence that ranges from 7\% to 89\% among trans populations and subpopulations. Further, 165 trans persons have been reported murdered in the United States between 2008 and 2016. GBV is associated with multiple poor health outcomes and has been broadly posited as a component of syndemics, a term used to describe an interaction of diseases with underlying social forces, concomitant with limited prevention and response programs. The interaction of social stigma, inadequate laws, and punitive policies as well as a lack of effective GBV programs limits access to and use of GBV prevention and response programs among trans populations. This commentary summarizes the current body of research on GBV among trans populations and highlights areas for future research, intervention, and policy.},

  abstract = {Is the functional ovarian reserve in transgender men affected by testosterone therapy?Serum anti-M\"ullerian Hormone (AMH) levels slightly decrease during testosterone treatment but remain within the normal range, suggesting preserved follicular ovarian reserve.Few small studies have investigated the impact of gender-affirming treatment on reproduction in transgender men. Conflicting results were reached concerning ovarian morphology and AMH levels in this context.The study consisted of two arms. The first arm was a prospective pilot study, which enrolled 56 transgender men (median age 22.5 [interquartile range (IQR)\textemdash 19\textendash 27.7] years), 27 of whom had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), prior to the initiation of gender-affirming testosterone therapy. A structured assessment was conducted prior to, and at 3 and 12\,months after treatment initiation. The second arm was a cross-sectional study that comprised 47 transgender men (median age 24 [IQR\textemdash 20\textendash 31] years) who received testosterone for a median duration of 35 [IQR 13\textendash 62] months. The main outcome measures were serum AMH and antral follicle count (AFC) as indices of ovarian follicular reserve.The study was conducted at a tertiary center for transgender health. Gender-affirming therapy was administered according to standard practice. AFC was determined by pelvic (abdominal or transvaginal) ultrasound and blood collection for measurements of AMH, testosterone, estradiol, LH and FSH was performed at the designated time-points.Prospective arm for the entire group we observed a decrease of 0.71\,ng/ml in AMH levels between baseline and 12\,months (P\,=\,0.01). When expressed in age-specific percentiles, AMH went from the 47.37th to the 40.25th percentile at 12\,months (P\,\&lt;\,0.001). In a sub-group analysis, a decline of 9.52 points in age-specific percentile was seen in subjects with PCOS (P\,\&lt;\,0.001), while no changes were detected in the non-PCOS group. Testosterone treatment did not affect AFC over time in the entire cohort. In the sub-group analysis, a mean decrease of 5.0 follicles was detected between baseline and the 12\,months assessment (P\,=\,0.047) only in subjects with PCOS. In the cross-sectional study, AMH inversely correlated with age but not with treatment duration. Notably AMH did not deviate from the 50th age-specific percentile. Finally, four men fathered biological children after being under testosterone treatment for up to 12\,years.The limited sample size of the pilot study should be kept in mind. An additional limitation is the lack of a control group in the prospective study, as each participant served as his own control. Also, roughly 40\% of the ultrasound examinations were performed transabdominally, potentially affecting the accuracy of the AFC measurements.As study participants were quite young, our reassuring data may not apply to older transgender men, either because of an age-related decline in ovarian reserve or to possible long-term effects of testosterone therapy. Furthermore, the chances for fertility preservation may be more limited in subjects with PCOS.This is an additional contribution to the emerging evidence that prolonged testosterone treatment may not be a major obstacle to later fertility potential in transgender men desirous of having children. Larger confirmatory studies, and particularly more with reproductive outcome data, are needed for evidence-based fertility counseling prior to treatment initiation in these subjects.This study received no funding. The authors have no competing interests to declare.N/A.},
