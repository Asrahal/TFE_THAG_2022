  abstract = {Introduction: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potential risk of estrogen therapy. However, data show an improvement in the quality of life for transgender people who use feminizing hormone therapy. With few transgender-specific data, guidance may be drawn from cisgender (nontransgender) data, with a focus on hormonal birth control and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The aim of this review is to examine the degree to which routes of administration, patient comorbidities, and type of hormone utilized affect the safety of estrogen therapy. Methods: We identified 6,349 studies by searching PubMed with the terms ``transgender'', ``estrogen'', ``VTE'', and ``HRT''. Of these, there were only 13 studies between 1989 and 2018 that investigated the effects of hormone therapy, including types of estrogens used, in transgender women and men. Results: The data suggest that the route of hormone administration, patient demographics, and patient comorbidities all affect estrogen's link with VTE. For example, avoiding ethinyl estradiol might make the use of hormone therapy in trans feminine individuals safer than oral birth control. Data from both cis and trans groups suggest additional VTE risk associated with the use of progestins. While transdermal estrogens dosed up to 0.1 mg/day or below appear lower risk for VTE than other forms of estrogen, it is unclear whether this is related to the delivery method or a dose effect. Finally, even if the risk from exogenous estrogen use remains significant statistically, the absolute clinical risk remains low. Conclusion: Clinicians should avoid the use of ethinyl estradiol. Additionally, data suggest that progestins should be avoided for transgender individuals. Further study of the relationship between estrogen use and the risk of VTE will serve to inform the safest care strategies for transgender individuals.},

  abstract = {Gender-affirming therapy with testosterone is commonly prescribed to aid in the masculinization of transgender men. Sex-hormone concentrations are routinely measured, but interpretation of results can be difficult due to the lack of published reference intervals.Healthy transgender individuals who had been prescribed testosterone (n\,=\,82) for at least a year were recruited from internal medicine and primary care clinics that specialize in transgender medical care. Total testosterone and estradiol were measured using immunoassay and mass spectrometry; LH, FSH, SHBG, prolactin, progesterone, anti-M\"ullerian hormone (AMH), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were measured using immunoassay; free testosterone was calculated. Reference intervals (central 95\%) were calculated according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.When evaluating general endocrine laboratory tests in people using masculinizing hormones, reference intervals for cisgender men can be applied for total and free testosterone and SHBG and reference intervals for cisgender women can be applied for prolactin. Reference intervals for estradiol, LH, FSH, AMH, and DHEAS differ from those used for cisgender men and cisgender women, and therefore should be interpreted using intervals specific to the transmasculine population. For testosterone and estradiol, results from immunoassays were clinically equivalent to mass spectrometry.Masculinizing hormones will alter the concentrations of commonly evaluated endocrine hormones. Providers and laboratories should use appropriate reference intervals to interpret the results of these tests.},

  abstract = {People whose gender does not correspond to the binary gender system, i.e., trans{${_\ast}$}gender people, face two main problems when it comes to healthcare in Germany: (1) They often suffer from general psychiatric comorbidities as well as specific and significant mental distress due to gender dysphoria, and (2) the German healthcare system lacks sufficiently educated and clinically experienced medical personnel who are able to provide specialized healthcare. Aside from transition, it often is extremely difficult for trans{${_\ast}$}gender people to get access to and be integrated into the medical system. Stigmatization and pathologization in treatment are widespread, as are long waiting times for specialized healthcare providers who are often only accessible to those trans{${_\ast}$}gender people willing to travel long distances. Frequently, trans{${_\ast}$}gender people face further difficulties and barriers after transition, as some healthcare professionals fail to provide suitable care (e.g., gynecological consultation for transmen). The ICD-11 German Modification (ICD-11-GM), which should be routinely used by 2022, implements a depathologization of trans{${_\ast}$}gender people in the medical system. This paper compares the issues related to health and healthcare of trans{${_\ast}$}gender people in Germany with those in other European countries. We review the care offered by specialized centers with regard to treatment of and support for trans{${_\ast}$}gender people. We conclude with specific proposals that may contribute to establish an improved, up-to-date, gender-sensitive healthcare system.},

In this paper, we present findings from a discourse analysis of four service users' and four healthcare professionals' talk about a primary care-based pilot clinic providing gender affirming hormone therapy in Aotearoa New Zealand. Participants employed notions of pathologisation, time, and agency in their talk to construct the clinic as a personal setting which gave service users time to make their own health decisions, while constructing hospitals as impersonal with lengthy wait times. The assessment-driven nature of best practice guidelines that governed clinicians' decision-making was constructed as constraining users' agency. Findings highlight the ongoing importance of aligning gender affirming hormone therapy with other non-disease types of healthcare, and suggest new ways for achieving this through affirmative approaches to healthcare.},

However, the health care delivery setting has not gained attention in research so far. Based on a systematic review and a global expert survey, we aim to investigate its role in transgender health care quality.MethodsWe performed two studies. In 2019, we systematically reviewed the literature published in databases (Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science) from January 2000 to April 2019. Secondly, we conducted a cross-sectional global expert survey. To complete the evidence on the question of (de-)centralized delivery of transgender health care, we performed a grey literature search for additional information than the systematic review and the expert survey revealed. These analyses were conducted in 2020.ResultsEleven articles met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review. 125 participants from 39 countries took part in the expert survey. With insights from the grey literature search, we found transgender health care in Europe was primarily delivered centralized. In most other countries, both centralized and decentralized delivery structures were present. Comprehensive care with medical standards and individual access to care were central topics associated with the different health care delivery settings.DiscussionThe setting in which transgender health care is delivered differs between countries and health systems and could influence different aspects of transgender health care quality. Consequently, it should gain significant attention in clinical practice and future health care research.},

Literature that only evaluated general lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) educational interventions was excluded. The lack of education in transgender care continues among providers across all levels of medical education from medical students and physician trainees to primary care providers, endocrinologists and other specialists involved in transgender care. Several interventions have been shown to effectively improve transgender knowledge and cultural competency. Education among healthcare providers is deficient and is considered a major barrier to care for transgender individuals. Effective interventions should be applied to fundamental medical education. Additional focused education also should be taught with specialty-appropriate content to produce needed proficiency among providers of transgender care.},

  abstract = {Purpose Transgender populations experience health inequities that underscore the importance of ensuring access to high quality care. We thematically summarize the health care experiences of transgender youth living in the southeast United States to identify potential barriers and facilitators to health care. Design and methods Transgender youth recruited from community settings in an urban area of the southeast United States participated in individual interviews (n~=~33) and focus groups (n~=~9) about protective factors. We conducted a thematic analysis of data from 42 participants who described their experiences seeking and receiving health care. Results Participants reported a wide range of gender identities. The individual interview sample was majority Black (54.5\%) and the mean age was 21.7~years and focus group participants were all white and the mean age was 16.8~years. Participants described numerous barriers to health care, including limited availability of gender affirming care, logistical challenges, such as gatekeeping and cost, concerns about confidentiality in relation to sexual behavior and gender identity, and inadequate cultural competency among providers regarding gender-affirming care. Facilitators included intake procedures collecting chosen pronouns and names and consistent use of them by providers, and open communication, including active listening. Conclusions Findings underscore the need for a multi-component approach to ensure both transgender- and youth-friendly care. Practice implications Providers and office staff may benefit from transgender cultural competency trainings. In addition, clinic protocols relating to confidentiality and chosen name and pronoun use may help facilitate access to and receipt of quality care.},

However, there is a gap in knowledge about trans men\textemdash those assigned a female sex at birth who identify as men or as transmasculine\textemdash including subgroups, such as trans men of color. Using data from the U.S. Transgender Survey, the largest transgender survey conducted in the United States, this study analyzes whether trans men's access to knowledgeable providers and their experiences of mistreatment in health care were related to demographic and mental health characteristics and degree of being ``out'' to providers. Among 7,950 trans men, respondent race and ethnicity, education level, disability status, psychological distress, suicidality, and being less ``out'' were associated with assessing one's health care provider as not knowledgeable about trans-related care. Mistreatment in health care was more common among Alaska Native/American Indian trans men; those who lived in or near poverty; those who were queer, pansexual, bisexual, or an orientation not listed; those with a disability; those experiencing distress or suicidality; and those who were more ``out.''

Design and methods A prolective observational study of consecutive TU injections in men undergoing testosterone replacement therapy for pathological hypogonadism or masculinization of female-to-male transgender (transmen) subject to individual dosing titration to achieve a stable replacement regimen. Results From 2006 to 2019, 6899 injections were given to 325 consecutive patients. After excluding the 6-week loading dose, 6300 injections were given to 297 patients who had at least three and a median of 14 injections. The optimal injection interval (mean of last three injection intervals) had a median of 12.0 weeks (interquartile range 10.4\textendash 12.7 weeks). The interval was significantly influenced by age and body size (body surface area, BSA) but not by diagnosis or trough serum LH, FSH, and SHBG. Longer ({$\geq$}14 weeks; 68/297, 23\%), but not shorter ({$\leq$}10 weeks; 22/297, 7.4\%), intervals were weakly correlated with age but not diagnosis or other covariables. Low blood hemoglobin increased with trough serum testosterone to reach plateau once testosterone was about 10 nmol/L or higher. Conclusion Optimal intervals between TU injection after individual titration resulted in the approved 12-week interval in 70\% of patients with only minor influence for clinical application of BSA and not of trough serum LH, FSH, and SHBG. Individually optimized inter-injection interval did not differ between men with primary or secondary hypogonadism or transmen.},

Although health care discrimination against transgender people has been documented, this issue is understudied. Using a national cross-sectional survey data set (N = 1,711), the authors sought to determine how gender identity and presentation predict health care discrimination experiences among female-to-male (FTM) transgender people after demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled. Analyses were conducted using chi-square tests and a two-step logistic regression. The majority of participants were white (73.9 percent) and between 25 and 44 years old (65.2 percent). Overall, 41.8 percent of FTM participants reported verbal harassment, physical assault, or denial of equal treatment in a doctor's office or hospital. When other factors were controlled, being Native American or multiracial, identifying as queer or asexual/other, having a graduate degree, living full-time as nonbirth gender, using hormones or surgery for medical transition, and having identification documents that list one's preferred gender were associated with increased reporting of health care discrimination experiences; being 45 years or older and reporting an annual income of \$60,000 or more were associated with decreased risk. The study's findings can be useful to social workers, who play a role in educating health care providers and advocating for policies that improve health care experiences for FTM and other transgender patients.},

Challenges dominated findings and could be summarized by lack of provider knowledge and sensitivity and financial and insurance barriers, which hurt TGNC people's health. Future qualitative research should explore the experiences of diverse and specific groups of TGNC people (youth, non-binary, racial/ethnic minority), include community-based methods, and theory development.

We reviewed the literature and interviewed nine key informants representing healthcare and service providers, researchers, and transgender advocates. Healthcare providers who care for transgender patients often demonstrate a lack of transgender competent care strategies. In addition, transgender people face many barriers to accessing HIV services. Although communication materials cannot address many of these barriers, materials specifically developed for transgender people and their healthcare providers would fill a gap and may increase uptake of HIV services. Materials for transgender people should include gender-affirming messaging and imagery, be framed in terms of resiliency, and present HIV information tailored to the needs of transgender people. Materials for healthcare providers should provide basic information to increase transgender competency and provision of comprehensive healthcare for transgender patients, inclusive of gender-affirming and HIV prevention, testing and care services. Channels for disseminating materials to transgender people and healthcare providers are described.},

  abstract = {American Sociological Review, Ahead of Print.   Between one-fifth and a third of people who are transgender have been refused treatment by a medical provider due to their gender identity. Yet, we know little about the factors that shape public opinion on this issue. We present results from a nationally representative survey experiment (N = 4,876) that examines how common justifications issued by providers for the denial of healthcare, and the race and gender identity of the person being denied care, intersect to shape public opinion concerning the acceptability of treatment refusal. We find that religious objections are viewed as less acceptable compared to a medical justification, in this case, inadequate training. However, the difference between religious objections and inadequate training is larger when the person being denied healthcare is White or Asian than when the person is Black or Latinx. Analysis of open-ended responses indicates the modest effect of doctor's rationale on attitudes toward treatment refusal with respect to Black and Latinx patients is partially attributable to a racialized, free-market logic. Respondents were more likely to advocate for a doctor's fundamental right to refuse service when evaluating Black and Latinx patients compared to White patients. We discuss the implications of these findings for intersectional approaches to trans studies and future public opinion research.},

  abstract = {Purpose:   Transgender (TG) individuals are a historically understudied and underserved patient population. Although clinical guidelines for the care of TG patients exist, quality measures (QMs) specific to this population are lacking. The goal of this study was to obtain expert input on aspects of care for which quality measurement may be appropriate and describe feedback on candidate QMs.  Methods:   We convened a virtual technical expert panel in September 2020 with six experts in TG medical care. Experts participated in a guided discussion and provided numeric ratings on dimensions of measure suitability (importance, validity/reliability, feasibility, and ease of understanding) for eight candidate QMs spanning multiple care domains (e.g., laboratory testing/monitoring, cancer screening, and sexually transmitted infection screening).  Results:   Panelists acknowledged high importance and potential to improve care for some candidate QMs, particularly those related to laboratory testing before initiating and during hormone therapy. Numeric ratings of QMs varied but tended to be higher for testing-focused QMs. Experts raised concerns about overly prescriptive language for some QMs and emphasized the importance of considering more flexible specifications to accommodate diverse care scenarios\textemdash including care provided to nonbinary individuals\textemdash and align with the individualized nature of gender-affirming care.  Conclusion:   These preliminary findings support a potential role for QMs in improving quality of care for TG patients. Measures related to laboratory testing/monitoring for patients who receive or plan to initiate hormone therapy may be feasible and promising to explore in the future. Additional larger-scale efforts are needed to develop and test QMs for the care of TG individuals.},
